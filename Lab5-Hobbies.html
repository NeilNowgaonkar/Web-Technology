                      I love playing chess in my free time. It is my hobby and passion. It not only keeps me busy but also gives me 
                      entertainment, refreshes me and provides me with a relaxation.
                      <br>
                      <br> Chess helps in developing decision-making abilities.
                      The strength of chess player lies in clear and normal thinking, right approach, reasoning and ability of not commiting a mistake.
  
                      <br><br>
                      Chess has taught me that we can execute our ideas and stratergies only if we possess intensiveness, creativity, imagination, 
                      willpower, determination, vision and the quick implementation of the plan.

                      I like to read books which teach me something like Rich Dad Poor Dad helped me to understand the importance of financial literacy or personality development books like atomic habits which showed me how small habits can help us to become better.
                      <br><br>
                      Books are the most impressive and long-lasting friends any person could ever have. It doesn’t matter if you’re a kid or an adult.
                      <br><br>
                      Apart from sharpening your mind, the lesson also allows you to explore different ways of looking at things and how people behave.

                        Analyzing stock market is a great hobby to understand news and their overall effects that it has on the entire market
                          <br><br> 
                          It teaches me the power of being patient and holding stocks it is a great way to start to be financially literate. As it is necessary to save money and understand where we should invest.
                    </p> Owning stocks in different companies can help you build your savings, protect your money from inflation and taxes, and maximize income from your investments but to get good profit we need to analyze the stock.
